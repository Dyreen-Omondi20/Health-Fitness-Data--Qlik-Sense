This project analyzes a health and fitness dataset containing participant information, activity logs, and health metrics. The goal is to visualize patterns in physical activity, health metrics, and lifestyle factors to gain actionable insights about participants’ fitness and well-being.

The dataset includes repetitive participant records, with multiple activities and measurements per participant over time. Using Qlik Sense, I built an interactive dashboard to explore trends, compare participant groups, and track key health indicators.
